# SLAM-and-Path-Planning-For-Autonomous-Machines
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) is crucial for an autonomous system to locate itself in space and map out its surrounding environment. It can then make a decision of what to do i.e "Plan its next move". This project is an implementation of the same.
